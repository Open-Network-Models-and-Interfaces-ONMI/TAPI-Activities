  + Coverage of missing/underspecified/unclear/erroneous old statements
- Photonic Model: continue the fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
  + Check transceiver profile and transceiver parameters
  + GOSNR (Generalized OSNR) approach and possible enhancements to the explicit profile
- Manual editing to improve autogenerated .yaml modules (see [here](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/tree/tapi-2.1.3-fixes) and [here](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/releases/tag/v2.1.4))
- UC 11a: “Modification of service path” and UML/YANG comments

**Discussion item 1**

General update

40 mins

1) Move to LF
   + This is the first TAPI call with the new [LF zoom](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/93452173395?password=985233ee-c9c6-4bd1-bb54-5b2a5acd622c)
   + No other news with respect to last week

2) New TAPI wiki pages
  + Andrea shows two new TAPI repositories:
    - [TAPI-Documentation](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI-Documentation)
      + to safely store all the TAPI documentation (RIAs, etc.), leaving in the [TAPI](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI) only the code (UML, YANG, OAS modules)
      + Note that a TAPI-documentation _release _has been created per each relevant TAPI SDK release:
        - [TAPI-documentation Release 2.1.3](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI-Documentation/releases/tag/v2.1.3)
        - [TAPI-documentation Release 2.4.0](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI-Documentation/releases/tag/v2.4.0)
        - [TAPI-documentation Release 2.4.1](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI-Documentation/releases/tag/v2.4.1)
        - [TAPI-documentation Release 2.5.0](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI-Documentation/releases/tag/v2.5.0)
    - [TAPI-Activities](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI-Activities)
      + to safely store all the TAPI documentation not candidate for a TAPI delivery:
        - Contributions for discussions, plans, backup of _TAPI wiki_
  + Regarding meeting minutes and dicussions, Andrea has centralized both in the [TAPI wiki](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/wiki)
    - Because the Github _wiki_ is easily clonable, while Github _discussions_ seems not
  - Roshan suggests [this link](https://til.simonwillison.net/github/migrate-github-wiki) for the migration of [TAPI wiki](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/wiki) to [TAPI-Activities wiki](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI-Activities/wiki)

**Discussion item 2**

Leverage the conditionality statements of RIA-TAPI 2.4/2.5 for RIA-TAPI 2.1.3
  + Coverage of missing/underspecified/unclear/erroneous old statements

20 mins

Nigel proposes to use recent RIA versions as reference for missing/underspecified/unclear/erroneous statements of older RIA versions (mainly RIA 1.1 of TAPI 2.1.3)
- For example, the _mandatory_ statement regarding equipment temperature
  + which can be fulfilled only if the detector is available, hence it is not _mandatory_ but _conditional_
- Agreed to create a new RIA ancillary document where to track these findings and related agreed solution
  + E.g. "old statement" is replaced by "new statement" according to RIA version x.y
  + Nigel will provide a first draft
