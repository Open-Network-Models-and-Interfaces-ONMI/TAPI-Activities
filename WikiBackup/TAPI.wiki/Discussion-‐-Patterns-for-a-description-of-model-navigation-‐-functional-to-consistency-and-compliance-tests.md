### [2024‐05‐21 TAPI Meeting Minutes](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/wiki/2024%E2%80%9005%E2%80%9021-TAPI-Meeting-Minutes)

Nigel presents some slides with examples of server and lower connection relationships
1) Connectivity Service "outer" navigation, with a proposal for navigation steps
   - Purpose is the automation of these navigation steps, to validate the correctness of data structure
2) Connectivity Service "inner" navigation, with a proposal for navigation steps
   - where more complex navigation paths can be defined
- In general, there is a requirement to define loops which can automatically validate most part of TAPI data structures.

- Andrea shows slide 142, 156, 157, 158 of onmi2024.AM.002_TAPI_RIASlides20052024.pptx

  + It is proposed a pattern to allow a clean split between L1 and L0 diagrams, to avoid duplication of management items along the slideset.
  + The approach is preliminary agreed.
